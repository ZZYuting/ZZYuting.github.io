假设你正在爬楼梯。需要 *n* 阶你才能到达楼顶。

每次你可以爬 1 或 2 个台阶。你有多少种不同的方法可以爬到楼顶呢？

**注意：**给定 *n* 是一个正整数。

**示例 1：**

```
输入： 2
输出： 2
解释： 有两种方法可以爬到楼顶。
1.  1 阶 + 1 阶
2.  2 阶
```

**示例 2：**

```
输入： 3
输出： 3
解释： 有三种方法可以爬到楼顶。
1.  1 阶 + 1 阶 + 1 阶
2.  1 阶 + 2 阶
3.  2 阶 + 1 阶
```

```c++

//bottom-up,time o(n), space o(1)
//Base cases:
//if n <= 0, then the number of ways should be zero.
//if n == 1, then there is only way to climb the stair.
//if n == 2, then there are two ways to climb the stairs. One solution is one step by another; the other one is two steps at one time.

//The key intuition to solve the problem is that given a number of stairs n, if we know the number ways to get to the points [n-1] and [n-2] respectively, denoted as n1 and n2 , then the total ways to get to the point [n] is n1 + n2. Because from the [n-1] point, we can take one single step to reach [n]. And from the [n-2] point, we could take two steps to get there.

//The solutions calculated by the above approach are complete and non-redundant. The two solution sets (n1 and n2) cover all the possible cases on how the final step is taken. And there would be NO overlapping among the final solutions constructed from these two solution sets, because they differ in the final step.

class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n==0){
        	return 0;
        }
        if(n==1){
        	return 1;
        }
        if(n==2){
        	return 2;
        }
        one_step = 2;
        two_step = 1;
        all = 0;
        for(int i=2;i<n;i++){
        	all = one_step + two_step;
        	two_step = one_step;
        	one_step = all;
        }
        return all;
    }
};
```
